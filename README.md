### Input  
The application doesn't require any user input. All of the information, including name, contact details, education, work experience, talents, and projects, is already included in the `Resume.js` file. The user must update the Resume.js file with their own information. The styles that dictate the appearance of the resume are contained in the `Resume.css` file.

### Process  
The `Resume.js` module separates the content into sections (e.g., education, abilities) using React. The resume looks polished thanks to the `Resume.css` file, which modifies the layout, fonts, and colors. When the program is run, React turns the code into a web page and applies the styles from the CSS file.

### Output 
The application displays the resume on a webpage. With a green background and black text, it looks tidy and well-organized. Because everything is already set up, the user merely needs to open the program in a browser to view the complete résumé.
