Input
In the To-Do List Application, there is a provision for the user to input the description of tasks via a text input field. The "Add Task" button adds more tasks onto the list upon click. Each task has been shown with a "Delete" button attached to it for removing purposes.

Process
The application utilizes the useState hook of React for handling the dynamic array of tasks. When the user clicks "Add Task," the new task is added into the state array. If the "Delete" button is clicked, the corresponding task is removed. The application refreshes the UI efficiently by using React's virtual DOM and its re-rendering processes.

Output
The result is a to-do list that updates visually. Added tasks come up immediately, and removed tasks get taken out of the list. That means the app can give a really smooth feeling for its user; it reflects the change dynamically without refreshing the page.
